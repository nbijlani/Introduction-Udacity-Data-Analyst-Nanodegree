# Summary

The objective of this analysis is to investigate questions that we could ask of the Titanic data set, elicit answers using Python to manipulate and query this data, and present the analysis via visualization and textual commentary. I analyze here the most important dependent variable: survival, in relation to the following independent variables: age, gender, class of travel and port of embarkation.
